I study real estate and household finance markets using various tools from the empirical industrial organization literature. My research focuses on sources of market power in the real estate value chain, including the single-family, multifamily, and housing mortgage sectors. Along with causal inference methods, I use theoretical and empirical models of consumer search and demand, business-to-business contracting, and competition among firms to assess broader economic implications. 

Here is a link to my [CV](/assets/pdf/cv.pdf).
